# Amazon_User_Segmentation
  - Segmentation of Amazon Users using K-means Clustering Algorithm.
  - to find the number of clusters that we should use , used elbow method
  - to check if clustering was done nicely or not, silhouette score can be used
  - scatterplot can be done if we use two features from the dataset
  - if more than two features are to be used , we can use PCA for dimensionality reduction but that will not be good when used for k-means clustering
  - unsupervised model -- we should be able to figure out meaning from the clusters formed.
